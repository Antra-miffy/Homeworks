  <input [(ngModel)]="bookname" #inputbook>
  <!-- The [(ngModel)] directive in Angular is used for two-way data binding between a form input and a component property.
  The square brackets ([]) are used for property binding, which sets the value of the component property to the value of the input element.
The parentheses (()) are used for event binding, which updates the component property when the input element's value changes. -->
